# Deconjugate.fr

This site is a French verb deconjugator created to help myself learn French.

It's running live on http://deconjugate.fr. Check it out!

# Dependencies

This app uses the great Verbiste library by Pierre Sarrazin (awesome, thanks!).
If you want to run it, you'll have to download and compile it. See
